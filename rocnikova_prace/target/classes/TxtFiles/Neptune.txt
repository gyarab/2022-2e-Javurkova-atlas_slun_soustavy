	Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun and is also known as an "ice giant" due to its composition, which is primarily made up of water, methane, and ammonia ices, along with rock and metal. The planet has a diameter of approximately 49,244 kilometers and a mass that is about 17 times that of Earth.

	Neptune's atmosphere is characterized by its blue color, which is due to the presence of methane gas. The planet also has an extremely active climate, with strong winds that can reach up to 2,100 kilometers per hour, the strongest in the solar system.

	Neptune has an extensive system of rings and at least 14 known moons. The largest moon, Triton, is believed to have been captured by Neptune's gravity and is one of the coldest objects in the solar system, with a surface temperature of about -235 degrees Celsius.

	Despite being discovered in 1846, Neptune remains a relatively mysterious planet, with much still unknown about its composition, atmosphere, and moons. However, several spacecraft, including Voyager 2 and the Hubble Space Telescope, have provided important data and insights into the planet's features and behavior.

	Neptune remains an important subject of study and exploration, with ongoing efforts to learn more about this fascinating planet and its place in the outer reaches of our solar system.
